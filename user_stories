Shoe Distribution
Write a program to track shoe brands and what stores they are in. Here are the user stories:

As a user, I want to be able to add, update, delete and list shoe stores.
As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands in the application (don't worry about updating, listing or destroying shoe brands).
As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands to a store to show where they are sold.
As a user, I want to be able to see all of the brands a store sells on the individual store page.
As a user, I want store names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
As a user, I do not want stores and shoes to be saved if I enter a blank name.
